The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages inside a media query.  For example, trying to calculate a width based on the viewport width and a percentage of another element's width fails. 
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  #element1 {
    width: calc(50vw - 20% /* of #element2's width */);
  }
}
```
